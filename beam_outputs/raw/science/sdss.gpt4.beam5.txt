SELECT I'm sorry, but it seems like the question is incomplete or there may have been a mistake. Could you provide more details or the complete question for generating the SQL statement?
SELECT I'm sorry, but the question "What is photometrically observed star" is not clear or complete enough for me to generate a specific SQL query. Typically, an SQL query requires information about what exactly you wish to select or filter on, such as specific attributes or conditions. Could you please provide more context or details related to what exactly you're seeking regarding "photometrically observed star"? With this information, I'd be happy to help further.
SELECT name FROM photo_type WHERE description LIKE '%star%' AND value IN (SELECT DISTINCT type FROM photoobj)
SELECT I'm here to help with SQL queries, but it seems like there's a bit of confusion with the phrasing of your question. To create an SQL query specific to a task related to photometrically observed stars, we need a clear objective or specific data-related task.
